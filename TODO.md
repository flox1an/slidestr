# TODO 

- hashtag view (single hasttag), header
- masonry, mit subtitles (user displayname, tags (most imporant), desc?, date) (ggf. nur desktop)
- NIP 46
- header für multiple tags??
- follow button für user view
- navigation entry points:
  - Curated Topics, i.e. defined hashtags -> topic view
  - Search (custom hashtags, profile search, content search, community seaarch)
  - Global
- community view
- community links in detail view (/masonry)

- Avatar display is laggy, needs caching
- turn settings dialog into a "search" and improve display on mbile
- bring back the desktop view of the details dialog (maybe!?)
- nip-46 nsecbunker login
- think about use of ui framework, and redesign settings dialog
- move NSFW block list into a list event on an slidestr.net profile (public nsfw mute list)
