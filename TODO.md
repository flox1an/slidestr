- grid profile: add banner/bio, maybe name to the right of the logo
- turn settings dialog into a "search" and improve display on mbile
- bring back the desktop view of the details dialog
- nip-46 nsecbunker login
- think about use of ui framework, and redesign settings dialog
- move NSFW block list into a list event on an slidestr.net profile
